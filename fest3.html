Holi ( /ˈhoʊliː/), also known as the Festival of Colours, the Festival of Spring, and the Festival of Love,[1][9][10] is an ancient Hindu religious festival and one of the most popular festivals in Hinduism.[1][11] It celebrates the eternal and divine love of Radha Krishna.[12][13] The day also signifies the triumph of good over evil,[14][15] as it commemorates the victory of Lord Vishnu as Narasimha Narayana over Hiranyakashipu.[16][17] It originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the Indian diaspora.[9][18][19][20][21][22]

Holi celebrates the arrival of spring, the end of winter, the blossoming of love and for many, it is a festive day to meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair broken relationships.[18][23] The festival is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season.[18][23] It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (Full Moon Day) falling in the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar. The first evening is known as "Holika Dahan" or "Chhoti Holi" and the following day as "Holi", "Rangwali Holi", "Dol Purnima", "Dhuleti", "Dhulandi",[24] "Ukuli", "Manjal Kuli",[25] "Yaosang", "Shigmo",[26] "Phagwah",[27] or "Jajiri".[28]</h3></p></i>
